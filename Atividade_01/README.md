# Atividade 1
This code reads a joystick x, y and z position and show in the terminal every 1000 millisseconds

# Explanation
This code reads the value of the analog-digital converter of two potentiometers inside the joystick
These values can be interpreted as a voltage divider between the vcc and gnd connected to the potentiometers terminals, 
meanwhile the position of x, y of the joystick can be approximatelly be represented by these values.
The joystick also have a button, that can be read to check if its pressed or not
